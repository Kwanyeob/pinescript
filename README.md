# pinescript


Pine Script is TradingViewâ€™s programming language. It allows traders to create their own trading tools and run them on our servers. 

I got into trading lately. I think it would be good to leverage programming language to trade. There isn't a "Rule", "Law", or "formula" but it wouuld be good to automate trading stratedy and some process or even backtests my strategy. 

It is not an official programming lanuauge, menaing by it is an universal programming lanugage across the globe, but it is always good to be exposed to some sort of programming language. 

I will try to update what I have been playing with.
